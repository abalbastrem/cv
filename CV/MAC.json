      "title": "Backend Software Developer +5 years | currently improving my understanding of devops practices",
      "description": "I have over five years of experience in backend development, using languages such as PHP, Java, Python, Node.js, and more recently I switched to Go (Golang). I also have experience in SQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Docker compose, REST APIs, DDD, hexagonal architecture, microservices, aws, cloud formation. I am now eager to learn more about modern solutions such as microservices in the cloud - queue brokers, AWS, Kubernetes, infrastructure-as-code and whatnot.\n\nI enjoy not just typing code, but understanding the product, the company, the costumers and the company and the market. I proposed significant changes in the recent past while at Tipsterchat: from the purely technical ones such as setting comfortable documentation and a good testing environment for fellow developers, to actively getting feedback from out top users to understand their needs and desires, and how they could become a market opportunity, by proposing a webpage design with unique aspects that set us apart.\nWhen there is a good match between the company and me, I have punched above my weight in the past: as a junior in DoTravel (only a year in the market), I was tasked to come up with a new architecture that was usable by other juniors, due to the CTO correctly identifying that I am a coder that likes clarity and design.\n\nI am currently looking for opportunities where I can grow into more senior positions, including mentoring juniors, having more responsibilities and participating in greater decision making. In parallel, I'd like to know more about modern solutions such as infrastructure-as-code, cloud services, microservices and queues, as well as async golang and advanced architectures.\n\nAs a sidenote, I enjoy several non-programming hobbies and projects. I sign in a metal band and I am producing a documentary about domestic violence. I used to work in media as a sound engineer so I have some artistic sensibilities with a strong technical background.",

    "desiredJobDescription": "I'd like a job that gets me invested. The job where I thrived the most was a startup where I could get involved in planning, giving feedback, proposing ideas, be critical, learning new technologies as needed, understand the business and whatnot. I always had a certain affiliation for software architecture since I dislike messy code, and I was allowed to propose a simple software architecture for said company. In the mid-long run, it'd be great if I could integrate my two careers: audio and code. In the meanwhile, I'd like to expand my horizons and move past simple, formulaic backend for webpages.",
    "goodPractices": "I like my code to be clean and clear, so other developers can iterate on that easily. I worked with TDD, SOLID principles, Clean Code and documentation."
